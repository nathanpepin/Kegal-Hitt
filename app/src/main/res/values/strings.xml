    <string name="about_text">
        \tThis application was developed by Nathan Pepin\n\n\t

        This application takes knowledge about kegals and integrates it with exercise science.
        \n\n\t

        The hypothesis is that the progressive overload model will allow for more sustainable progress in regard to kegal exercises.
        \n\n\t

        For instance, someone who is getting started with weight lifting will generally select a lower weight that they can handle, and over time they will increase the load as they get stronger.\n\n\t
        When the increase in load is kept manageable over a long period of time, there is potential for significant increase in strength. The app applies this concept to kegls.
        \n\n\t

        \n\n\t

        The current release of the software will not contain ads, but ads are likely to be added in the release to support development.
        I want to ensure that the application is working on a wide spectrum of devices before any sort of monetization occurs, and it is difficult for me to test that as a single developer.
        \n\n\t

        I would prefer a donation based model for the app, but Google policies on apps that take donations is a little unclear.
        Many app developers report not having any issues but others report that their account got shut down.
        I am doing more research to ensure whatever I do is compliant with TOS.
        \n\n\t

        This app is built off the foundation of Mental HIIT, which utilizes the same concept yet in regard to mindfulness.
        Most of the functionality remains the same, but the progression model is modified to be more suitable for kegals.
